Tutorials are quick, one-off, mostly self-explanatory snippets to get your new users up and running with your library.
If you have any recipe-like, step-by-step guides on how to do more involved tasks with your library, this page would
be the best place to put those. This would be good for users who have decided they want to use your library (thanks
to your easy, well-written tutorials), but they need help learning how to do a more complicated task. 

Each section here should clearly mark what the goal is, and the guides themselves should be recipe-like with enumeration
of steps and short explanations of *what* (read: not *why* or *how*) you are accomplishing.

## How to do something
We are going to try to do something with our code.

1. Import the library into your code: `import picrom`
2. Do something with the code: `picrom.do_something()`
3. That's it!
