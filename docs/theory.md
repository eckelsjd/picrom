Here would be a good place to go into all the good theory of _how_ your code works. This would be more focused on
_explanation_ rather than a tutorial, step-by-step style. You should include all the important equations and also link
to any relevant journal articles or online resources.

The interested reader here probably already uses your code and knows their way around the API (thanks to your 
beautifully written API reference). So you don't need to even mention the code. You just need to explain the 
algorithms and mathematical concepts underlying your code; that's what your reader is most likely on this page for.
