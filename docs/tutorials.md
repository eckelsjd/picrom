On the tutorials page, you want to show some basic usage of your code. Show the simplest, "lowest-barrier-to-entry" things
that a new user can do with your code. The point is to get them up and running and for them to quickly test if your project
is going to have the things they need. For each section, your title should explain the purpose/goal of the tutorial, and the
tutorial itself should mostly be simple, short, and readable code.

You should *not* include long, lengthy descriptions of how the code works or provide every intricate option for the primary
functions and methods. These are better reserved for the API reference.

## Code snippet example
Here is an example of how to cut and paste from your source code directly into the documentation.
```python title="example.py"
--8<-- "picrom/example.py:example_name"
```
