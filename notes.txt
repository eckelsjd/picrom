Warp-X:
- dt=5e-12 s per timestep
- total of 4,000,000 iterations/time-steps, up to tf= 20us
- Save file every 4000 iterations, total of 1000 save files with 20ns per file

Benchmark details:
- no collisions
- source ionization term and cathode electron injection
- Te, Ex, and ni are important benchmarked parameters
- Te = 2/3 * (1/2) * sum_k (E_{e,k} - m_e * <u_{e,k}>^2) -- need to convert E_{e,k} * c^2*m_e (J) and u_e*c (m/s)
- 2.5cm x 1.28cm in the axial-azimuthal directions with dx=dy=50um < 70 um debye length
- Nx by Ny = 500x256
- dt=5ps with tf=20us
- 150 ppc


TURF:
Important files:
- Experiment 3 outputs csv file has 3D data output details
- TURFdata/16AB_1e9_Nd8/Plot3DExp3p2 has parts 1/2 vts files
- Plot3DExp3p1 only has part 1 data before a failed restart
- Update 4/28 slides have most recent results and links to scripts
- TURF_CPU/src-TURF/tutorials/post_processing/*extract.py use vtk library to gather all the data from plot3dexp3p1
- Boyd.csv files are hand-extracted from the original paper pdf, located in the post_processing folder

Simulation details:
- Experiment 3 replicates the Boyd paper
- 16AB is the most recent/best version of experiment 3
- green rows in .csv are the outputs that are saved
- part1 --> neutrals only injected (up to iteration 1500)
- part2 --> ions injected
- weird time-average properties from part 1 are used to initialize part 2
- part 1 dt=1e-5 s, part 2 dt=5e-6 s
- vts files saved every 50 iterations up to 12500 iterations
- thruster surface is triangular unstructured mesh
- plume volume is a regular cubic/rectangular structured mesh
- Nd8 = 8 subdomains used in TURF
- only mesh field quantities are saved (not particles)
- 8 .vts files per iteration, one for each subdomain

Physics info:
- electron fluid with DSMC/MCC neutral/Xe+ ?

File formats:
- .vts --> structured volume data (mesh quantities)
- .vtr --> information about subdomain boundaries to visualize in paraview
- .pvts/.vtm --> give info about how subdomains are connected
